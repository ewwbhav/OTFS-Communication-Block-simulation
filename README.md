# OTFS-Communication-Block-simulation
This project simulates an OTFS communication system over an Additive White Gaussian Noise AWGN channel. Key components implemented include Inverse/Symplectic Finite Fourier Transforms ISFFT/SFFT and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM. Performance was evaluated by generating a Bit Error Rate BER vs. Signal-to-Noise Ratio SNR plot.
